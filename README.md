# Rebot
Rebot provides a platform to automate debugging. Checkout the frustration of developers at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkrzA5LUPxI
This project takes the first step in automating the process of typical developer searching for solution. 
The idea is to find the right fix that solves his specific personal problem.

## Why?
Rebot provides a platform for anyone to query for feature sets that help in finding a right solution for any given error.
Since the number of softwares used currently are increasing exponentially, having an automated mechanism to provide concise viable solutions helps 
developers write awesome code and also save a lot of time. 

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is not to automate debugging but give a platform for developers to build tools that help solve their specific problems.
